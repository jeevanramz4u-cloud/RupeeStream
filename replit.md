# Overview

EarnPay is a video monetization platform where users earn money by watching videos. The application implements a comprehensive system with user authentication, video management, earnings tracking, referral programs, and administrative controls. Users must watch videos completely (no skipping/fast-forwarding) and meet daily targets to maintain account status. The platform includes verification processes, payout management, and real-time chat support.
